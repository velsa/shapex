Thanks for the interview, Eran!

You asked me to think about this problem and I did just that :)

## Deployment on Vercel

See the working version here: https://shapex.vercel.app/

## The Code:

Source files are in the `src/app` directory.

The main code for UIX is in the files `page.tsx` and `canvas.tsx`

The data model (linked list) is in the `shapex.ts` file

## Working locally:

To run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
